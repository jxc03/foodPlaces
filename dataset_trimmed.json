            "content": "Went there for our son’s 40th Birthday celebrations which I had told them about when booking for 10 people. Very disappointed in preparation as it was nil. In fact I asked for table upstairs and was shown to table downstairs at the door which hadn’t room for 10 . I could say a lot more about the attitude of the guy who I think owns the restaurant but to say the least his attitude was appalling . I. sensed there was some problem which wasn’t of my making and it certainly was no way to treat paying customers. The rest of the staff were really friendly and helpful. The food which was served promptly was absolutely gorgeous and plenty of it. I had the steak sandwich and it was easily the nicest I’ve ever tasted. The chips were big and golden. and everyone commented on how lovely the food was. The bill was fine and the only thing I had a problem with the £33 service chargeI’. If it goes directly to staff then grand but customers should be given the option to pay. We always leave a generous tip in restaurants but like to have the option. I’ve  been to Embers on many occasions but after Sat night I can’t see me going back. The reason for no stars for atmosphere is because there wasn’t any.",

We also bought scones for later that evening however as they looked so tasty we sampled one with our tea. Everything was fresh and cooked to perfection. The refills of our tea made everything even better. The staff were friendly and the place was clean bright and welcoming. The scones we had later were also delicious, we took a variety of the flavours. I highly recommend Hedleys.",

The best thing about my lunch was the chips, the pie was lacking in taste, neither carrot or onion was in it, the other lunch was just as bad but the mashed potatoes lacked seasoning.\nThey do a good pot of soup, and we wished we had gone with that option.",

In Derry, the best specialty coffee shops are charging 3.30at most for a coffee like a cappuccino, so my expectations were definitely very high. However, the cappuccino when it arrived was huge - which I guess explains the pricing - however, it tasted more like a Latté, a weak Latté at that. The sizing was far too big and I think it would be beneficial to charge a lower price for a smaller size, or at least provide a smaller option. The coffee itself was fine, definitely not worth the premium price being charged. When I entered, initially the staff were really nice, however the staff working at the till and serving the coffee were unpleasant and seemed like they would rather be somewhere else, which ruined the atmosphere a little. I think this place could be really nice and I was planning on returning to try food some other time, however with such a mediocre experience, there are better café options elsewhere in the city.",
